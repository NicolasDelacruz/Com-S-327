Notes:
-Used Jeremy Sheaffer's assignment 1.02 solution, and built off that solution.

Description:
This program uses Djikstra's algorithm and heaps to generate paths for the two types of monsters.
Tunnel Monsters:
-Monster that tunnel through walls

Non-tunnel monsters:
-Monsters that can only move through open space

This algorithm will first display the generated map (like previous versions), then display the non-tunnel monster's path map, and lastly the tunnel-monster's path map.

The following describes what logic was used to configure the order of path (when sending to heap):

Things to note (all monsters):
-8 way pathings (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)

Non-tunnel monsters:
-ignore walls, this will keep path within rooms an corridor
-all floors have weight of 1

Tunnel monsters:
-cells with a hardness of 0 have a weight of 1
-cells with hardnesses in range [1, 254] have weights of hardness / 85


Through these requirements and using Dijkstra's algorithm and heaps the reulting 2 maps are generated.
