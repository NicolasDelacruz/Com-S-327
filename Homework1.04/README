Program description of how it SHOULD work:
In this program I used the solution for homework 1.03. 
This program's purpose is to generate an input number of monsters using a new switch "--nummon" following an integer as an input or 10 by default.
After monsters are generated they are assigned the following:
*speed: random between 10-20
*turn: 0
*id: random between 1-16

There are 4 characteristic:
Intelligent: understand the dungeon layout and move on the shortest path (as
per path finding) toward the PC
Telepathic: always know where the PC is. Non-telepathic monsters only know
the position of the PC if they have line of sight (smart ones can remember the position where they
last saw the PC when line of sight is broken).
Tunnelling: can tunnel through rock.
Erotic: have a 50% chance of moving as per their other characteristics.

Those 4 types created 16 possibilities, hence 1-16 for ID.

As monsters and PC took their turn the 'turn' attribute was updated with + (1000/speed). The monster or pc with lowest turn went next, this keeps going until pc kills last monster or monster kills pc.

UNFORTUNATELY, the heap was not working and not letting the monsters move, everything else should work ecept the monsters cannot move because the heap is not working appropriately.
