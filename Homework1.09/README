Program description:
    -This program is generate monsters and item objects from the description files.
    -Creating objects of items:
    	      -Created a new_item class to generate these items, and used the same values that we stored in the objects_description class.
	      -placing the objects in the map, I added another terrain type that indicated the type of item
	      -if the terrain type was item then the program calls a function get_item_symbol and get_color that would return the symbol and color(s)
    -Creating objects of monsters:
    	      -For creating monster types I created an method in the monster_description class (which can store all the monster information) and created a new npc instance in that method and returned it.
	      -This would then be used in gen_monsters when we generate monsters to iterate through the monsters stored in the vector in the dungeon
