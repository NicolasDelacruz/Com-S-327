This program uses switch arguments to load and save games. 
There is also a third switch ("--load --save") that loads the game then saves it.
The additional functionality of load is done by reading the binary file and converting all the values to usable map information, then printing it out.

The additional functionality of save is done by writing the map information to a file in the hidden directory "./rlg327", this file is written in big endian format.
